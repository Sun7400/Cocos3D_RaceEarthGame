 * Constructs the 3D scene prior to the scene being displayed.

 * Adds 3D objects to the scene, loading a 3D 'hello, world' message
 * from a POD file, and creating the camera and light programatically.
 *
 * When adapting this template to your application, remove all of the content
 * of this method, and add your own to construct your 3D model scene.
 *
 * You can also load scene content asynchronously while the scene is being displayed by
 * loading on a background thread. The
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1) To help you find your scene content once it is loaded, the onOpen method below contains
 *    code to automatically move the camera so that it frames the scene. You can remove that
 *    code once you know where you want to place your camera.
 *
 * 2) The POD file used for the 'hello, world' message model is fairly large, because converting a
 *    font to a mesh results in a LOT of triangles. When adapting this template project for your own
 *    application, REMOVE the POD file 'hello-world.pod' from the Resources folder of your project.

#pragma mark Drawing

/**
 * Template method that draws the content of the scene.
 *
 * This method is invoked automatically by the drawScene method, once the 3D environment has
 * been established. Once this method is complete, the 2D rendering environment will be
 * re-established automatically, and any 2D billboard overlays will be rendered. This method
 * does not need to take care of any of this set-up and tear-down.
 *
 * This implementation turns on the lighting contained within the scene, and performs a single
 * rendering pass of the nodes in the scene by invoking the visit: method on the specified
 * visitor, with this scene as the argument.
 *
 * You can override this method to customize the scene rendering flow, such as performing
 * multiple rendering passes on different surfaces, or adding post-processing effects, using
 * the template methods mentioned above.
 *
 * Rendering output is directed to the render surface held in the renderSurface property of
 * the visitor. By default, that is set to the render surface held in the viewSurface property
 * of this scene. If you override this method, you can set the renderSurface property of the
 * visitor to another surface, and then invoke this superclass implementation, to render this
 * scene to a texture for later processing.
 *
 * When overriding the drawSceneContentWithVisitor: method with your own specialized rendering,
 * steps, be careful to avoid recursive loops when rendering to textures and environment maps.
 * For example, you might typically override drawSceneContentWithVisitor: to include steps to
 * render environment maps for reflections, etc. In that case, you should also override the
 * drawSceneContentForEnvironmentMapWithVisitor: to render the scene without those additional
 * steps, to avoid the inadvertenly invoking an infinite recursive rendering of a scene to a
 * texture while the scene is already being rendered to that texture.
 *
 * To maintain performance, by default, the depth buffer of the surface is not specifically
 * cleared when 3D drawing begins. If this scene is drawing to a surface that already has
 * depth information rendered, you can override this method and clear the depth buffer before
 * continuing with 3D drawing, by invoking clearDepthContent on the renderSurface of the visitor,
 * and then invoking this superclass implementation, or continuing with your own drawing logic.
 *
 * Examples of when the depth buffer should be cleared are when this scene is being drawn
 * on top of other 3D content (as in a sub-window), or when any 2D content that is rendered
 * behind the scene makes use of depth drawing. See also the closeDepthTestWithVisitor:
 * method for more info about managing the depth buffer.

/**
 * Pre-loads certain assets, such as shader programs, and certain textures, prior to the
 * scene being displayed.
 *
 * Much of the scene is loaded on a background thread, while the scene is visible. However,
 * the handling of some assets on the background thread can interrupt the main rendering thread.
 *
 * The GL drivers often leave the final stages of shader compilation and configuration until
 * the first time the shader program is used to render an object. This can often introduce a
 * short, unwanted pause if the shader program is loaded while the scene is running.
 *
 * Unfortunately, although resources such as models, textures, and shader programs can be loaded
 * on a background thread, the final stages of shader programs compilation must be performed on
 * the primary rendering thread. Because of this, the only way to avoid an unwanted pause while
 * a shader program compilation is finalized is to therefore perform all shader program loading
 * prior to the scene being displayed, including shader programs that may not be required until
 * additional content is loaded later in the scene on a background thread.
 *
 * In order to ensure that the shader programs will be available when the models are loaded
 * at a later point in the scene (usually via background loading), the cache must be configured
 * to retain the loaded shader programs even though they will not immediately be used to display
 * any models. This is done by turning on the value of the class-side isPreloading property.
 *
 * In addition, the automatic creation of mipmaps on larger textures, particularly cube-map
 * textures (which require a set of six mipmaps), can cause excessive work for the GPU in
 * the background, which can spill over into a delay on the primary rendering thread.
 *
 * As a result, a large cube-map texture is loaded here and cached, for later access once
 * the model that uses it is loaded in the background.

#pragma mark Drawing

/**
 * Template method that draws the content of the scene.
 *
 * This method is invoked automatically by the drawScene method, once the 3D environment has
 * been established. Once this method is complete, the 2D rendering environment will be
 * re-established automatically, and any 2D billboard overlays will be rendered. This method
 * does not need to take care of any of this set-up and tear-down.
 *
 * This implementation turns on the lighting contained within the scene, and performs a single
 * rendering pass of the nodes in the scene by invoking the visit: method on the specified
 * visitor, with this scene as the argument.
 *
 * You can override this method to customize the scene rendering flow, such as performing
 * multiple rendering passes on different surfaces, or adding post-processing effects, using
 * the template methods mentioned above.
 *
 * Rendering output is directed to the render surface held in the renderSurface property of
 * the visitor. By default, that is set to the render surface held in the viewSurface property
 * of this scene. If you override this method, you can set the renderSurface property of the
 * visitor to another surface, and then invoke this superclass implementation, to render this
 * scene to a texture for later processing.
 *
 * When overriding the drawSceneContentWithVisitor: method with your own specialized rendering,
 * steps, be careful to avoid recursive loops when rendering to textures and environment maps.
 * For example, you might typically override drawSceneContentWithVisitor: to include steps to
 * render environment maps for reflections, etc. In that case, you should also override the
 * drawSceneContentForEnvironmentMapWithVisitor: to render the scene without those additional
 * steps, to avoid the inadvertenly invoking an infinite recursive rendering of a scene to a
 * texture while the scene is already being rendered to that texture.
 *
 * To maintain performance, by default, the depth buffer of the surface is not specifically
 * cleared when 3D drawing begins. If this scene is drawing to a surface that already has
 * depth information rendered, you can override this method and clear the depth buffer before
 * continuing with 3D drawing, by invoking clearDepthContent on the renderSurface of the visitor,
 * and then invoking this superclass implementation, or continuing with your own drawing logic.
 *
 * Examples of when the depth buffer should be cleared are when this scene is being drawn
 * on top of other 3D content (as in a sub-window), or when any 2D content that is rendered
 * behind the scene makes use of depth drawing. See also the closeDepthTestWithVisitor:
 * method for more info about managing the depth buffer.
